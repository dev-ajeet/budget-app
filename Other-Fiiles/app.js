/*******************************
 * We will use modules for our program. We created modules because we want to create peices of code that are related to one another togther, inside seperate, independent and organized units. 
 * Each of these modules will have variables and functions, that are private - which means they are only accessible inside of the module. Therefor no other code can override our data. 
 * Besider private variables and methods we also going to have public methods. Which means we are going to expose them to public. So that other functions or modules can access and use them. 
 * This is called Data Encapsulation 
 * Data Encapsulation allows us to hide implementation details of a specific module from the outside scope, so that we only expose a public interface which is sometime called API. 
 * We use module pattern to create application in javaScript. We need to know the concepts of 'clousers' and 'IIFE'
